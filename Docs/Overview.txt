** OVERVIEW **

This is a windows form managing a collection of scripts designed to mutate (munge)
clipboard content.  It has a built-in development tab, test tab, and admin tab (store / update).
The scripts implement an interface, and are compiled on the fly.  The form also has a tray icon
allowing quick launching of a script.  Several fully-functional, example scripts are
contained within the project.

** SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS **

- Windows XP or later
- .NET Framework 4

** INSTALLATION **

Use the installation package provided.

On first run, change the default script folder to the location
where you wish to store/use scripts.

That's it.

Things I am still trying like to add:
- Incorporate the CSharp highlighter and Intellisense from AIMS.Scripting if possible.
  (This is in progress, but is quite the beast).

Version History:
03/04/2010 -- Mutiple enhancements
  - Adjusted anchoring for proper redraw when resizing.
  - Added split panes to various tabs to enhance resizing, and cleaned up anchoring.
  - In the dev tab, double-clicking on an error would move the caret to the specific line,
    but would not scroll the text to the caret if it was out of view.  The text is now
    auto-scrolled to show the highlighted line.
  - Added usersettings.xml to the user's app data folder to persist the user's script 
    directory selection between executions.
  - Added change detection to a script, and user confirmation dialog when attempting to switch
    script selection when current script is not saved to/current with the disk file.
  - Added an extra tab to the develop tab, to allow external assembly references, as
    well as the existing GAC references.
  - Added a tray icon to allow the main window to be hidden upon minimize, and the scripts to 
    be launched from a context-menu (right click) from the tray icon.
  - Added code to ensure only one instance of Clipboard Munger can be exected.
  - Implements protection against orphaning the tray icon.  See this post for details:
