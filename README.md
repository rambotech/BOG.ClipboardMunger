# BOG.ClipboardMunger
A Windows tray utility with user-configurable scripts to take clipboard text content, and replace it with some change.  Very useful for software deveopers.  Contains a set of scripts I have developed over the years, and has a highlighting text edit for C# or Visual Basic to edit the scripts pr build your own.
